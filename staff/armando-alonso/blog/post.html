                <ul>
                    <li>Bitcoin price dropped sharply to the $18,500 support.</li>
                    <li>Ethereum dived to $1,265, XRP is down over 10%.</li>
                    <li>QNT and RSR are up over 5%.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Bitcoin price attempted a strong increase above the $20,000 resistance zone. BTC failed and declined
                    sharply below $19,000. It is currently (03:10 UTC) showing bearish signs, but it is testing a major
                    support at $18,500.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, most major altcoins started a steady decline. ETH broke the $1,300 support and declined
                    to $1,265. XRP is down over 10% and trading near the $0.42 support. ADA might move towards the $0.42
                    support zone.
                </p>
                <h3>Bitcoin price</h3>
                <p>
                    After a decent increase above the $19,500 resistance, bitcoin price attempted more upsides. BTC
                    cleared the $20,000 resistance zone and the 50-hour simple moving average. However, the bears were
                    active below the $20,500 resistance. The price formed a short-term top and started a fresh decline
                    below the $20,000 level. It declined over 5% and broke the $19,000 level. On the downside, an
                    initial support is near the $18,500 level. The next major support is near the $18,350 zone, below
                    which the price could slide to $17,500.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $19,000 level. The next major resistance is
                    near $19,150, above which the price might start a steady increase.
                </p>
                <h3>Ethereum price</h3>
                <p>
                    Ethereum price also followed a similar pattern after it was not able to clear the $1,400 resistance
                    zone. ETH reacted to the downside below the $1,350 support. It even broke the $1,300 level and the
                    50-hour simple moving average. On the downside, an initial support is near the $1,265 level. The
                    next major support is $1,255, below which price could test $1,200.

                <p>
                    On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,300 level. The next major resistance is
                    near the $1,320 level, above which the price could visit the $1,350 resistance.
