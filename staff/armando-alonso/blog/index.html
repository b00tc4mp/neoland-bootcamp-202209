                    After a decent increase above the $19,500 resistance, bitcoin price attempted more upsides. BTC
                    cleared the $20,000 resistance zone and the 50-hour simple moving average. However, the bears were
                    active below the $20,500 resistance. The price formed a short-term top and started a fresh decline
                    below the $20,000 level. It declined over 5% and broke the $19,000 level. On the downside, an
                    initial support is near the $18,500 level. The next major support is near the $18,350 zone, below
                    which the price could slide to $17,500.

                    Joe teased an upcoming project announcement as well, “We’re able to better secure the network for
                    better capital on the networks instead of being held at liquid, waiting for users to use at DeFi.
                    Governance by proxy is such a prominent feature of Quicksilver and will hopefully be on the Mainnet
                    soon.”

                    Polygon is a decentralized platform for Web3 applications and dApps meant to better some of
                    Ethereum’s most significant shortcomings. It improves scalability, user-friendliness, and Ethereum’s
                    high transaction fees. Despite being crypto’s most popular smart contracts platform, the ETH network
                    isn’t compatible with other blockchains, and it often gets congested, causing high transaction fees.
